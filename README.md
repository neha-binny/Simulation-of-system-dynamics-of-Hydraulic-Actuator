# Simulation-of-system-dynamics-of-Hydraulic-Actuator
In this project, I developed a SIMULINK block that simulates the system dynamics of the hydraulic actuator for a step external force, F = 2.044kN applied
to the load at time t = 0. The uploaded images contains the block schematic of hydraulic actuator, and the description of system dynamics.
